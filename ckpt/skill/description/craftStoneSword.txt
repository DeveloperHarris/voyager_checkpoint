async function craftStoneSword(bot) {
    // The function crafts a stone sword using cobblestones and sticks. It checks if there is a crafting table nearby, and places one if there isn't. It then checks if there are enough cobblestones and sticks in the inventory, and mines/crafts more if necessary. Finally, it crafts a stone sword and sends a chat message.
