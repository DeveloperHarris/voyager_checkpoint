async function craftIronChestplate(bot) {
    // The function is about crafting an iron chestplate. It checks if there is a crafting table nearby, and if not, it mines oak logs and crafts oak planks to make a crafting table. It then places the crafting table near the player. Next, it checks if there are enough iron ingots in the inventory, and if not, it mines iron ores and smelts them using a furnace. Finally, it crafts an iron chestplate using the crafting table and 8 iron ingots.
