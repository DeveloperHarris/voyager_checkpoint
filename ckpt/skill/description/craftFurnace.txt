    // The function crafts a furnace using cobblestones. It checks if there are enough cobblestones in the inventory, and if not, it mines more using a stone pickaxe. Then, it places a crafting table near the player and crafts a furnace using the cobblestones. Finally, it sends a chat message indicating that the furnace has been crafted.
